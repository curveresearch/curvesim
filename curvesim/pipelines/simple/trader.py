        Compute trades to arbitrage the pool, as follows:
            1. For each coin pair i and j, calculate size of coin i
               needed to move price of coin i w.r.t. to j to the
               target price.
            2. Calculate the profit from each such swap.
            3. Take the swap that gives the largest profit.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prices : pandas.Series
            Current market prices from the price_sampler.

        Returns
        -------
        trades : list of :class:`Trade` objects
            List of trades to perform.

        additional_data: dict
            Dict of additional data to be passed to the state log as part of trade_data.
